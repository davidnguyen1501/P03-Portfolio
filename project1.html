           <h1>Overview</h1>
            <div class = description>
            <p>This project was worked on by a team of 3 and was presented as a final project in an Animation course (IAT 343) offered at Simon Fraser University, the project requires us to create a 3-5 minutes long animation
                with a unique and well planned plot with convincing narrative to push forward in Autodesk Maya, we have to divide our tasks individually and each have to take part in making the entire animation
                We had around 8 weeks to plan out the project, brainstorming and drawing the storyboard, creating individual 3D models in Autodesk Maya and finally put them together in a completed animation video</p>

            <h2> Ideation Process </h2>
            <div class = description>
               <p> To start off with the project, we had to brainstorm some ideas for the plot and create a storyboard.One of my teamates suggested doing an animation featuring bees so we decided to work on a plot based on it. 
                   I was responsible in creating rough sketches and planning out the camera angle used in the final animation, it is important that we choose the right angle in our final animation so
                   we were really careful with picking the right angle while making the storyboard. In addition we also take inspiration from many popular animated movie like Up or Frozen when creating our
                   character, background set up and dialouges, our goal was to make the movie suitable for every target audience.

                  <h2> Modeling </h2>
                  <div class = description>
                     <p> We used AutoDesk Maya to model our Bees and texturing it using Photoshop, I was responsible for making the main Character, creating the shape and skeleton to turn him into a lively being. 
                       the main challenge I faced when creating the bee model is the rig hiding beneath him, I wanted to make sure that his model doesn't get distorted during animation so I have to carefully watch
                       many tutortials and asked for the teacher's help before finalizing our main character.

            <h2> Animating </h2>
            <div class = description>
            <p> Animation was for sure the toughest part, it took us a lot of time and effort to get everything done right, I was responsible for animating the begining scene of the movie. After completing all the models needed for the animation,
              we started putting everything together, we need to make sure the models look great in every shot and the lightings are good enough to improve the quality of the final product. The main problem
              we encountered while taking the screen shots is to make the raining effects for one of our scenes, we had to go through multiple tutorials before we could get the effect to work on our animation

   <h2> Final animation </h2>
   <div class = description>
    <p> Because of the Covid-19 pandemic none of the students could meet each other to make the full animation with colors so the instructors decided to tell us to make a still animation
      with the colors instead. Initially we had some trouble communicating with each other through Zoom but we managed to complete our video in time and the professor was really satisfied with
      our work.
