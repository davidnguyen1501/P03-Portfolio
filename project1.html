           <h1>Overview</h1>

            <p>This project was worked on by a team of 3 and was presented as a final project in an Animation course (IAT 343) offered at Simon Fraser University, the project requires us to create a 3-5 minutes long animation
                with a unique and well planned plot with convincing narrative to push forward in Autodesk Maya, we have to divide our tasks individually and each have to take part in making the entire animation
                We had around 8 weeks to plan out the project, brainstorming and drawing the storyboard, creating individual 3D models in Autodesk Maya and finally put them together in a completed animation video</p>

            <h2> Ideation Process </h2>

               <p> To start off with the project, we had to brainstorm some ideas for the plot and create a storyboard.One of my teamates suggested doing an animation featuring bees so we decided to work on a plot based on it. 
                   I was responsible in creating rough sketches and planning out the camera angle used in the final animation.
